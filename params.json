A `version control` is a system that records the changes being \r\nmad on a file in this case our repositories. Git screenshots the coding and it does not need \r\ninternet to run. It runs in your `local` computer. Git does not need GitHub to run. Git is used by all \r\ndevelopers. Git is in your command line. After you are complete with making your directory. you can just \r\n`git add` and `git commit` we will get more into that in Workflow & Commands.\r\n\r\n**_GitHub_** is the cloud that contains the repositories. This helps save files incase something goes \r\nwrong on the local machine. GitHub has to be run by Git. In this case internet in required to connect\r\nto the cloud. GitHub can be usefull if a person needs to share his or her files with another person. \r\nGitHub is the `remote`. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Initial Setup\r\nFor using GitHub you need to go to [Github](http://github.com)  \r\nMake an account and sign into your account.  \r\nSet up `SSH key` to connect GitHub with your command line.  \r\n\r\nFor an example on [Nitrous](http://nitrous.io)  \r\n  1. Go on username  \r\n  2. Dashboard  \r\n  3. SSH Key tab  \r\n  4. copy SSH Key  \r\n\r\nOn GitHub   \r\n  1. Go into your profile.  \r\n  2. Go into Settings  \r\n  3. Go to SSH keys  \r\n  4. Click on Add SSH Keys      \r\n  6. Give it a title (example: Nitrous)  \r\n  5. Paste your Key   \r\nOnce you are in your container open IDE  \r\n \r\nAnd now you have to *_Start Coding_* on your command line   \r\n`ssh -T git@github.com`  and type \"yes\"    \r\nNow you have to `git config`:  \r\nFirst make a dirictory:  \r\n`mkdir first-repo`  \r\n`cd first-repo`  \r\n`pwd` to check where you're at  \r\nyou should be at /home/nitrous/first-repo  \r\n`git init`  \r\n`git config --global user.name “First Last”`  \r\n`git config --global user.email “your email”`  \r\n####You are command line is now coonected with GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Repository Setup\r\n`pwd` to check where you are  \r\nYou should be in /home/nitrous/first-repo  \r\nThere should be `(master)` writen next to it confirming that you are using Git  \r\n`touch README.md`  \r\nopen the README > WHATEVER YOU WANT TO WRITE  \r\nFor Nitrous you have to manually save.  \r\n`git add README.md`   \r\ngit commit -m “commit message (ex; add readme)”  \r\nBack in GitHub go to the `+`  \r\nNew Repository  \r\nRepository name: first-repo (has to be the same)  \r\nCreate Repository  \r\nClick SSH next to URL  \r\nCopy the `git remote`  \r\nNow copy the `git push`  \r\nNow refresh your GitHub page and you should be able to see the changes.  \r\nFrom now you just work on you README.md \r\nAdd and Commit  \r\nAnd `git push` no need for the `-u orgin master`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Workflow & Commands  \r\n`git` a git command  \r\n`remote` we are setting up a connection between our current repository and an external one  \r\n`add` to add a repo into file   \r\n`origin` this is our “nickname” for the remote repo.    \r\n`URL` the location of the remote repo.    \r\n`push` we are sending our commits from our local repo to our remote repo  \r\n`-u` means “upstream.” This remembers which remote repo & branch to push our changes to when    \r\nwe type “git push” in the future.  \r\n`origin` this is which remote we are pushing to  \r\n`master` the “main” branch of your project   \r\n`pull` bring any changes from the remote to the local   \r\n`git init` initializes git in our directory/repository for version control, only do this once\r\nat the beginning  \r\n`git status` optional command to see which files have been edited since the last commit    \r\n`git add file.ext` add the file to the stage to be committed   \r\n`git commit -m “specific message”` take a snapshot of the repo, present-tense and describe what was changed  \r\n`git log` see your past commits  \r\n`git diff` see the difference between your current code and the previous commit\r\n`git clone URL` clones remote repo to local\r\n\r\n---\r\n##Colaboration  \r\nYou are able to colaborate and share another persons repo by `forking` it from his or her remote to yours,\r\n`cloning` into your local computer, making your own changes, then `pushing` it back to your repo. \r\nAfterwards you can send a `pull request` to the him or her once he or she likes the changes, they can \r\npull it into their remote and save it as a commit.  \r\n1. Go on GitHub  \r\n2. Go on the persons repo  \r\n3. Fork it  \r\n4. It should be sent to your Remote  \r\n5. Clone it down to your local  \r\n6. Make your changes  \r\n7. Push it back up to your remote   \r\n8. Do a pull request, once the person confirms he can commit it.  \r\n\r\nIf someone sent you a pull request you simply go into your repo, go to your pull requests.\r\nLook at it. If you like it CONFIRM. And that will be your snapshot. You can then clone it\r\ndown to your Local and work on it from there.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
