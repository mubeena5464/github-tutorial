mad on a file in this case our repositories. Git screenshots the coding and it does not need 
internet to run. It runs in your local computer. Git does not need GitHub to run.

**_GitHub_** is the cloud that contains the repositories. This helps save files incase something goes 
wrong on the local machine. GitHub has to be run by Git. In this case internet in required to connect
to the cloud. GitHub can be usefull if a person needs to share his or her files with another person.
