## Git vs. GitHub
**_Git_** is a type of `verion control`. A `version control` is a system that records the changes being 
mad on a file in this case our repositories. Git screenshots the coding and it does not need 
internet to run. It runs in your `local` computer. Git does not need GitHub to run. Git is used by all 
developers. Git is in your command line. After you are complete with making your directory. you can just 
`git add` and `git commit` we will get more into that in Workflow & Commands.

**_GitHub_** is the cloud that contains the repositories. This helps save files incase something goes 
wrong on the local machine. GitHub has to be run by Git. In this case internet in required to connect
to the cloud. GitHub can be usefull if a person needs to share his or her files with another person. 
GitHub is the `remote`.

  6. Give it a title (example: Nitrous)  
  5. Paste your Key   
Once you are in your container open IDE
